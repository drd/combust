TODO
- calculate x coordinates by time rather than slot
  - port mousemove handler to BSP
  - if initial visible sample is not == first time visible:
    - ugh, convert min/max tree to use range of sample.t -> sample.t + sample.duration
      - narf
- support retina
  - extract canvas setup?
- replace magic numbers
  - width & height calculations
- mousemove should use offscreen blit for as much as possible
- fix text rendering with variable height
  - move ui -> App.state
  - probably split some components or at least layout functions out
