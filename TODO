TODO
- calculate x coordinates by time rather than slot
  - port mousemove handler to BSP
    - move to a much sparser representation
- support retina
  - extract canvas setup?
- replace magic numbers
  - width & height calculations
- mousemove should use offscreen blit for as much as possible
  - introduce t-range parameterized render func
  - blit offset visible area of current frame 
  - render dirty rect -> onscreen
  - re-render full frame after debounced mousewheel complete
    - to compensate for offset-specific text?
- fix text rendering with variable height
  - move ui -> App.state
  - probably split some components or at least layout functions out
