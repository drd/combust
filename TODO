TODO
- calculate x coordinates by time rather than slot
  - if initial visible sample is not == first time visible:
    - find previous sample, and draw with its x as 0
    - ugh, convert min/max tree to use range of sample.t -> sample.t + sample.duration
      - narf
- support retina
  - extract canvas setup?
- replace magic numbers
  - width & height calculations
