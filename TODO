TODO
- calculate x coordinates by time rather than slot
  - port mousemove handler to BSP
- support retina
  - extract canvas setup?
- replace magic numbers
  - width & height calculations
- mousemove should use offscreen blit for as much as possible
- fix text rendering with variable height
  - move ui -> App.state
  - probably split some components or at least layout functions out
